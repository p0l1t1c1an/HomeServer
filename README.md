# HomeServer
A repo to document the creation of my home server.

### How Documention is Handled

#### Project Kanban Boards
I have two projects for this repository to keep track of what I have learned and implemented regarding my server.
How these are managed are described below.

#### Learning
- Open issues that are put into the learning project correspond to topics and concepts that I need to further my understanding in.
- When I close these issues, this corresponds to me learning what I set out to learn.
- Reopening issues means that I that I did not learn everything I needed or there is something new I need 
  to learn that is closely related the issue(s) that I reopened. 
- I will be documenting what I learned in the *Learned* directory. 
  - Within the directory, there will be subdirectories that have the same or similar names to the issues I open.
  - Within those, I will include guides I followed, books I read, web sources I utilized, and mini projects 
    I completed that helped me learn about the topic.  

#### Implementing
- Open issues that are put into the implementing project correspond to ideas and services that I want to implement in my home server.
- Closing these issues means that I have implemented what I set out to create.
- If an issue is reopened, that means there was / is a big issue with what I created that I need to redocument. 
- I will be documenting what I implemented in the *Implemented* directory.
  - This directory will have the same structure as *Learned* 
  - Will contain config files and steps to recreate what I implemented. 
  - I will also document all issues that I discover in development.  

### Why Document This on Github
- This helps me keep on top of what I plan on learning and creating  
- It allows me to easily reflect on what I have done and keep track of my growth
  - I will be able to look back and see how far I am in the [Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
  - Basically, a log file for my growth as I develop this project
- I enjoy writing and planning things out, and that is quite literal all this repo is
- But I also enjoy being a little chaotic and using things in unintended ways
  - Using Github's system this way definitely seems less that intended
- As well, this is probably the most verbose and simplest way that I can set this up
  - Github offers me this system readily so I might as well use it
