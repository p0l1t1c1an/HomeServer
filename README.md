# HomeServer
A repo to document my FreeBSD server and how to config and utilize these software running on it. 

### How Documention is Handled

#### Software, Services, and Config Files
- In this repo, I will create directories called the software/service, s/s, running on the server
  - These directories will contain a Readme and config files for the the s/s
  - The Readme will go over the ideas of the s/s and describe the config files purpose
- The s/s may not be what is permanently running on my FreeBSD server
  - Much of these, are for me to mess around with and get to understand how they work
  - Then, if I want to reuse them, I have easy access to descriptive configurations and details
- As well, I would like to work on many different OSes other than FreeBSD
  - I would like to try setting up OpenBSD, a Linux Hypervisor, and maybe OmniOS
  - Then, I can set up many different services and learn different ideas 
- Finally, I am currently thinking about creating an OpenBSD router in Summer 2021
  - So I am starting off with FreeBSD and migrating to OpenBSD for that purpose 

### Why Document This on Github
- This help remind me what I have created in the past and how to recreate it  
- It allows me to easily reflect on what I have done and keep track of my growth
  - I will be able to look back and see how far I am in the [Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
  - Basically, a log file as I develop this project
- I enjoy writing and planning things out, and that is quite literal all this repo is
- As well, this is probably the simplest way that I can set this up that is techinally "permanent"
